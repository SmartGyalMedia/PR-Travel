        <h2>A Rich & Resilient History</h2>
        
        <div class="two-column-text">
            <p>
                The island's history begins with its indigenous people, the Taíno, who called it <i>Borikén</i>. After Christopher Columbus arrived in 1493, the island was a Spanish colony for over 400 years, shaping its language, religion, and core culture.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1898, after the Spanish-American War, Spain ceded the island to the United States. This began a complex new chapter in Puerto Rican history, one marked by a proud and fierce fight for identity.
            </p>
            <p>
                From 1948 to 1957, "Law 53" (known as the <i>Ley de la Mordaza</i> or "Gag Law") made it illegal to display a Puerto Rican flag, sing a patriotic song, or even speak of independence. This is one of the reasons why Puerto Rican people are so passionate and proud to wave their flags.
            </p>
            <p>
                This resilience was famously shown in 1977, when a group of 30 Puerto Rican nationalists took over the Statue of Liberty, unfurling a Puerto Rican flag from her crown to demand independence and the release of political prisoners.

        <h2>Cultural Facts</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">
            From world-famous rum to a hat with deep meaning, here are a few facts that make the island unique.
        </p>

                <img src="images/about-coqui.jpg" alt="A small Coquí frog on a leaf">
                <h3>The Coquí Frog</h3>
                <p>The beloved "co-KEE" call is the island's soundtrack. This small tree frog is a national symbol and hatches as a tiny froglet, skipping the tadpole stage entirely.</p>
            </div>

                <h3>The Cathedral of Rum</h3>
                <p>Located in Cataño, the Casa Bacardí distillery is the largest rum distillery in the world. Rum is a cornerstone of the island's economy and culture.</p>
            </div>

<div class="gallery-item">
    <img src="images/about-pava.jpg" alt="A traditional pava straw hat">
    <h3>The Pava Hat</h3>
    <p>
        The <strong>pava</strong> is the traditional straw hat of the <i>jíbaro</i> (rural farmer), a powerful symbol of resilience and national pride. Modern artists like Bad Bunny have brought this icon to the global stage, famously wearing it at the Met Gala and during his recent tour on the island.

                <img src="images/about-guiro.jpg" alt="A musician playing a güiro">
                <h3>The Güiro</h3>
                <p>This percussion instrument was invented by the Taíno people. It's a hollowed-out gourd with notches, and its scraping sound is essential to Puerto Rican music like plena and seis.</p>

        <h2>Experience the True Island Life</h2>
        
        <p class="section-intro">
            To truly know Puerto Rico is to taste it, hear it, and live it. 
            Go beyond the resorts and discover the island's vibrant local culture.
        </p>

        <p>
            Take a hands on cooking class and learn to make <strong>sofrito</strong>, the island's magic seasoning base. Time your visit for the holidays to experience traditions like homemade <strong>coquito</strong> and <strong>pasteles</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Food is a way of life here. Explore the famous "Ruta del Lechón" (Pork Highway) for world class roasted pork, or stop at a local *kiosko* (stand) for fresh fruit and sweet <strong>pilones rojos</strong> (red lollipops sometimes topped with sesame seeds).
            Cool down like a local with a <strong>limber</strong> (a homemade icee using fresh fruit) or a <strong>jugo de ajonjolí</strong>, a sweet sesame drink similar to horchata. For the freshest meal, you can even take a charter to catch and grill your own fish.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's impossible to be in Puerto Rico and not feel the music. It spills out of cars, homes, and corner stores. From classic guitar to the rhythm of the <i>coquí</i> frog at night, the island has a constant, beautiful soundtrack. Check out <strong>La Placita de Santurce</strong> over the weekend, where you can usually find locals dancing to live salsa right on the street.
